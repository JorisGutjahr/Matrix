<h1> Matrix </h1>
<p>
My goal for this code was to implement my own ndarray in C.
But I got a little bit diffrent perspective then most of todays implementations are like.
Most of them are like an array in an array in array and so on. I don't know if 
the liberaies for Arrays also implemented in this way, but they made this mind construct for the 
developers who are using these libaries.
I see another way to work with multidimensionality:
I define the Array as a Matrix that you should be familiar if you know linear algebra.
So that with adding a dimension you just add a new element to each column of the Matrix.
